For this project, I created a seven page website that illustrates and organizes plots made with Matplotlib regarding weather data near the equator. I used HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring Latitude vs. X analysis of weather.

Test web design page <a href="https://alliecarlile.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/visualizations/landingpage.html">here</a>

This website was designed with the following features:


At the top of every page, website has a navigation bar.

Websites consists of seven pages as follows:

A landing page that contains the following elements:

An explanation of the project.

A link to each visualization page. For these, a sidebar contains a preview image of each visualization. Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

Four visualization pages, stored in the visualizations folder, each with the following elements:

A descriptive title and a heading tag.

The visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs. max temperature, latitude vs. humidity, latitude vs. cloudiness, or latitude vs. wind speed). The images that these pages display are stored in the assets/images folder.

A paragraph describing the visualization and its significance.

A comparisons page that does the following:

Contains all the visualizations on the same page so that people can easily compare them.

A Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. This grid contains two visualizations across a medium or large screen and one visualization across an extra-small or small screen.

A data page that displays a responsive table containing the data that the visualizations use.
